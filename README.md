# Calorie Tracker

**Simple, personalized, and efficient calorie and macro tracking.**

## üöÄ Overview

The Calorie Tracker is a mobile application designed to help you monitor your dietary intake with precision and ease. Unlike generic tracking apps, this app allows for granular customization of meal components, weights, and nutritional overrides, making it perfect for those tracking complex, homemade, or culturally specific meals. The goal is to make tracking a seamless part of your daily routine.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Home Screen (Daily Overview)

* **Daily Summary:** Quickly view your total calorie intake for the day right on the **Home** screen. (e.g., **787.30kcal**).
* **Intuitive Date Selector:** Easily navigate between days using the calendar widget to check past or plan future entries.
* **Personalized Greeting:** Start your day with a motivating and personalized welcome message.
* **Today's Meals:** See a detailed list of all meals logged for the current day, including total weight and calorie count (e.g., **Jollof and Chicken**).

### Meals Management

* **Custom Meal Database:** View and manage a personal list of recurring meals and their standard nutritional values (e.g., **Jollof** at **250.0kcal/100g**).
* **Search Functionality:** Quickly find existing meals to log or edit using the **Search meals...** bar.
* **Efficient Editing:** The simple dropdown icon on each meal allows for quick edits or viewing detailed information.

### Detailed Meal Logging (Add Meal)

* **Composite Meal Creation:** Combine multiple **Submeals** (like **Jollof** and **Chicken Thighs**) into one entry, making it easy to log complex dishes like a full plate.
* **Weight & Unit Customization:** Enter the precise weight and unit (e.g., **234g**) for each submeal to calculate the exact calories consumed.
* **Calorie Overrides:** **Override Calories per unit** or **Macros** (Protein, Carbs, Fats) to ensure accuracy when the default meal data doesn't match your specific preparation (e.g., lower fat chicken thighs).
* **Flexible Data Entry:** Add custom protein and carb counts for highly accurate macro tracking.
